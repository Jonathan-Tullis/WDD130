        <p>I am studying Software Engineering. I want to go into software development, but I also have a strong interest in cybersecurity!</p>

        <p>
            I’ve been married for almost a year—our anniversary is next week! We don’t have any kids yet. I see a big advantage in learning web design, especially as AI becomes more prominent in tech. Knowing how to build a website from scratch is a valuable skill.
            <br><br>
            Through this class, I hope to learn the basics of web development and also connect with classmates. In my personal life, this will help me build websites for my projects. For example, I do solo game development and am reaching the point where I need to start marketing. Building my own website will save money and improve my skills.
        </p>

        <p>I’ve always been a member of the Church. I don’t have a favorite quote from Church leaders, but my favorite scripture is probably Isaiah 41:10.</p>
