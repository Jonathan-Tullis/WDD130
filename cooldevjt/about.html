    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Jonathan Tullis, a passionate beginner in software and game development. I love making things and learning by building projects. My main tools are Unreal Engine, C++, and Python.</p>

  <h2>How I Got Into Dev</h2>
  <p>I’ve always been curious about how things work—especially tech and games. A few years ago, I started learning Python and C++, and that turned into building simple games. Now I’m studying software development seriously, and working on side projects all the time.</p>

  <h2>What I’m Learning</h2>
  <p>Right now, I’m focused on learning Unreal Engine with C++, improving my web development skills, and exploring how design and code come together to make good experiences. I don’t know everything yet, but I love the process of figuring it out.</p>

  <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>
  <p>If you’re a developer, gamer, or someone just starting out—reach out! I’m always down to connect and collaborate. You can use the contact links on the site or follow me through the projects I share here.</p>
