  <h2>My Indie Game Projects</h2>
  <p>This page shows off my current and past game projects. Most are built in Unreal Engine or Unity, and they reflect a mix of creativity and experimentation. You’ll see screenshots, descriptions, what tech I used, and where to play them if they’re available online.</p>

  <h2>Project Development Logs</h2>
  <p>For each game, I like to break down the development steps. I’ll walk through challenges I hit (bugs, scope creep, design issues), and how I solved them. This gives anyone following along a transparent look into what it’s really like to build something solo.</p>

  <h2>Future Goals</h2>
  <p>Some games are works in progress. I’ll share what I plan to add or fix and ask for feedback when I can. My dream is to keep evolving these ideas into something people enjoy playing. This site will track that process.</p>
