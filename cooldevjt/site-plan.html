      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Hey, I’m Jonathan Tullis. I’m learning to become a software developer, and in my free time, I make indie games by myself. My personal website will show the projects I’ve worked on, like apps I’ve built and games I’m creating. It’s a place where I can share my progress, what I’m learning, and what I’m excited about. I want it to be simple, easy to explore, and a way for others to see what I can do. If you’ve ever been curious about how someone gets started in coding or game development, this site will give you a real look at the process.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        This site is made for anyone curious about coding, game development, or indie game design. It’s especially for students, new developers, or recruiters looking to understand what I can do. Most visitors will be between 16–35 years old and want to explore my personal projects or connect with a self-starting developer. I want them to browse my portfolio and learn about my process or even reach out.
      </p>

      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <strong>Welcome to My Journey</strong>
      <p>Hi! I'm Jonathan Tullis, a beginner software developer and solo indie game creator. This site is my personal space to share my projects, progress, and everything I'm learning along the way. Whether you're curious about how to get started in development or just like to see behind-the-scenes of someone figuring it all out, you're in the right place.</p>

      <strong>Why I Built This Site</strong>
      <p>People always ask how you break into coding or start making games. I figured the best way to answer that was to show them. This site is my open journal—my portfolio, sandbox, and devlog all in one. I wanted a place to keep track of what I’ve built and share it with others who might be on a similar path or just curious.</p>

      <strong>What You'll Find Here</strong>
      <p>I’ll show off my personal projects (like platformers and puzzle games), talk about the tools I’m learning (C++, Unreal Engine, Python), and give updates as I improve. My main goal is to be real and honest about the learning process—what works, what fails, and what’s fun.</p>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <strong>My Indie Game Projects</strong>
      <p>This page shows off my current and past game projects. Most are built in Unreal Engine or Unity, and they reflect a mix of creativity and experimentation. You’ll see screenshots, descriptions, what tech I used, and where to play them if they’re available online.</p>

      <strong>Project Development Logs</strong>
      <p>For each game, I like to break down the development steps. I’ll walk through challenges I hit (bugs, scope creep, design issues), and how I solved them. This gives anyone following along a transparent look into what it’s really like to build something solo.</p>

      <strong>Future Goals</strong>
      <p>Some games are works in progress. I’ll share what I plan to add or fix and ask for feedback when I can. My dream is to keep evolving these ideas into something people enjoy playing. This site will track that process.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <strong>How I Got Into Dev</strong>
      <p>I’ve always been curious about how things work—especially tech and games. A few years ago, I started learning Python and C++, and that turned into building simple games. Now I’m studying software development seriously, and working on side projects all the time.</p>

      <strong>What I’m Learning</strong>
      <p>Right now, I’m focused on learning Unreal Engine with C++, improving my web development skills, and exploring how design and code come together to make good experiences. I don’t know everything yet, but I love the process of figuring it out.</p>

      <strong>Let’s Connect</strong>
      <p>If you’re a developer, gamer, or someone just starting outreach out! I’m always down to connect and collaborate. You can use the contact links on the site or follow me through the projects I share here.</p>
